# Ramanujacharya on Saptavidha Anupapatti
## The Seven Great Untenables

Ramanujacharya put forward the concept of Saptavidha Anipapatti, 
or seven great untenables, to challenge the Advaita Vedanta school's view of
 Maya as an illusory force. These seven great untenables can be summarized as follows:

- 1. The first untenable is that Maya cannot be considered a cause, because
		a cause must have some positive existence or reality. However, if Maya is an
		illusion or non-existent, it cannot be considered a cause.
		
- 2. The second untenable is that Maya cannot be considered a product or effect, 
		because a product or effect must have some positive existence or reality. However,
		if Maya is an illusion or non-existent, it cannot be considered a product or effect.

- 3. The third untenable is that Maya cannot be considered a substratum, because a 
		substratum must have some positive existence or reality. However, if Maya is an illusion
		or non-existent, it cannot be considered a substratum.

- 4. The fourth untenable is that Maya cannot be considered as an attribute of Brahman,
		because an attribute must have some positive existence or reality. However, if Maya is an
		illusion or non-existent, it cannot be considered as an attribute of Brahman.

- 5. The fifth untenable is that Maya cannot be considered as a superimposition, because a 
		superimposition requires both the substratum and the superimposed to have some positive
		existence or reality. However, if Maya is an illusion or non-existent, it cannot be considered as a superimposition.

- 6. The sixth untenable is that Maya cannot be considered as a negation, because a negation 
		cannot be the cause of anything. However, if Maya is an illusion or non-existent, it cannot be considered as a negation.

- 7. The seventh untenable is that Maya cannot be considered as something that is both real 
		and unreal simultaneously. If Maya is real, it cannot be unreal, and if it is unreal, it cannot be real.

These seven great untenables highlight the inconsistencies and contradictions in the Advaita 
Vedanta school's view of Maya as an illusory force. Ramanujacharya's critique of Maya is an 
important aspect of the Vishishtadvaita school of thought, which sees Maya as a real and 
active force that operates under the control of God.
