## Chandrakirti Madhyamaka philosophy

Chandrakirti was a Buddhist philosopher and scholar who lived in India in the 
7th century CE. He is known for his commentary on the Middle Way (Madhyamaka)
 philosophy of Nagarjuna, which is one of the most influential philosophical systems in Buddhism.

Chandrakirti's commentary on the Middle Way philosophy is called the "Clear Words"
 (Sanskrit: Prasannapada), and it is considered one of the most authoritative texts on 
 Madhyamaka philosophy. In his commentary, Chandrakirti expands on Nagarjuna's concept 
 of emptiness (shunyata) and applies it to various areas of Buddhist philosophy.

One of Chandrakirti's key contributions to Buddhist philosophy is his concept of "two truths."
 According to Chandrakirti, there are two levels of truth: the conventional truth and the ultimate
 truth. The conventional truth refers to the everyday reality that we experience, while the ultimate
 truth refers to the ultimate nature of reality, which is empty of inherent existence.

Chandrakirti argued that the ultimate truth of emptiness cannot be understood through ordinary 
language or conceptual thinking. Rather, it can only be realized through the practice of meditation
 and contemplation. However, he also emphasized that the ultimate truth does not negate the 
 conventional truth, but rather it provides a deeper understanding of it.

Another important concept in Chandrakirti's philosophy is the idea of dependent origination 
(pratitya-samutpada). According to this concept, all phenomena arise in dependence on causes 
and conditions, and they are empty of any inherent existence or self-nature. This idea is closely 
related to Nagarjuna's concept of emptiness and is a central tenet of Madhyamaka philosophy.

Chandrakirti's philosophy is still studied and debated today in Buddhist circles. His contributions
 to the understanding of Madhyamaka philosophy have had a significant impact on Buddhist thought, 
 particularly in the Tibetan tradition, where his works are studied alongside the works of Nagarjuna 
 and other influential Buddhist philosophers.
