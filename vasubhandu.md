## Vasubandhu Madhyamaka philosophy

Vasubandhu was a Buddhist philosopher and scholar who lived in India in the 4th
 to 5th century CE. He was one of the most influential Buddhist philosophers of his
 time and is known for his contributions to the Yogacara school of Buddhist thought.

One of Vasubandhu's key contributions to Buddhist philosophy is his concept of
 "store consciousness" (alayavijnana). According to Vasubandhu, the mind is composed 
 of eight consciousnesses, including the five sensory consciousnesses, the mind consciousness, 
 and the store consciousness. The store consciousness is the foundation of the other consciousnesses 
 and contains the seeds or potentialities of all our experiences.

Vasubandhu also developed the concept of "mind-only" (cittamatra) in his works. According to this 
concept, all phenomena are ultimately mental in nature and arise from the mind. This idea is closely
 related to the Yogacara school's emphasis on the role of consciousness in shaping our perceptions and experiences.

In addition to his work on consciousness, Vasubandhu also developed the concept of 
"dependent origination" (pratitya-samutpada). According to this concept, all phenomena arise in
 dependence on causes and conditions, and they are empty of any inherent existence or self-nature.
\ This idea is a central tenet of Buddhist philosophy and is closely related to the concept of emptiness 
(shunyata) developed by Nagarjuna.

Vasubandhu's works, such as the "Abhidharmakosa" and the "Vimsatika," are still studied and debated 
today in Buddhist circles. His contributions to the Yogacara school of thought and the understanding 
of consciousness have had a significant impact on Buddhist philosophy and continue to influence Buddhist
 thought and practice.
