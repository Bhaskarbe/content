# Nagarjuna On Shunyavada

Nagarjuna was a Buddhist philosopher who lived in India in the second century CE,
 and he is known for his influential work on the concept of emptiness or shunyata. 
 In his work, Nagarjuna introduced the concept of Chatur Koti, which translates to
 "four-cornered negation." Chatur Koti is a method of reasoning that Nagarjuna used 
 to negate all possible views or concepts of reality, in order to arrive at the truth of emptiness.

One of the concepts that Nagarjuna applied Chatur Koti to was the concept of the self or atma.
 According to Nagarjuna, the self cannot be found or identified using any of the four possible positions 
 of Chatur Koti. These four positions are:

- The self exists.
- The self does not exist.
- The self both exists and does not exist.
- The self neither exists nor does not exist.
Nagarjuna used each of these four positions to show that the self cannot be identified or
 found in any of them. For example, if we take the first position that the self exists, Nagarjuna argued 
 that the self cannot be found within the physical body or the mind, nor can it be found as a separate 
 entity apart from the body or the mind. Similarly, if we take the second position that the self does not exist, 
 Nagarjuna argued that there is still the experience of subjectivity or self-awareness, which cannot be denied.

Nagarjuna's conclusion was that the concept of the self is empty or devoid of inherent existence. 
The self is not a separate entity or substance that exists independently of the body and mind, nor is it an illusion 
or a product of the mind. Rather, the self is a dependently originated phenomenon that arises in dependence on 
the body and mind, and it is empty of any inherent existence or self-nature.

The concept of Chatur Koti and Nagarjuna's view on the self as empty has had a significant impact on
 Buddhist philosophy and is still studied and debated today. The idea that the self is empty of inherent
 existence has been applied to many other concepts in Buddhism, including karma, rebirth, and even the 
 ultimate nature of reality itself.
