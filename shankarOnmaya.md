# ShankaraCharya on Maya

According to Shankaracharya, Maya is like a veil that covers the ultimate reality, Brahman. 
Maya is an illusion that prevents us from perceiving the true nature of Brahman. 
Shankaracharya believed that the material world we experience is not real, but an illusion created by Maya.
 The concept of Maya is closely associated with Advaita Vedanta, which is a non-dualistic philosophy 
 that asserts the identity of the individual self (Atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

Nagarjuna, on the other hand, was a proponent of Madhyamika philosophy, which is a form of
 Mahayana Buddhism. According to Madhyamika, the world is empty of inherent existence (Shunyata), 
 and all phenomena are devoid of any independent reality. Nagarjuna believed that everything is 
 interdependent and interconnected, and that all things arise in dependence upon other things.
 He argued that the concept of Maya is a mistaken belief in the inherent existence of things.

In conclusion, both Shankaracharya and Nagarjuna addressed the concept of Maya in their respective
 philosophies, but they had different views on its nature and implications. While Shankaracharya saw
 Maya as an illusion that veils the ultimate reality, Nagarjuna viewed it as a mistaken belief in the inherent 
 existence of things.
